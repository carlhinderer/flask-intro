- Introducing Flask

    - Flask is a small 'micro-framework'.  It has a core and basic services, but was
        designed with extensibility from the ground up.  You pick the extensions
        you need.


    - Flask has 3 main dependencies:

        1. Routing, debugging, and WSGI subsystems from 'Werkzeug'
        2. Template support from 'Jinja2'
        3. Command-line integration from 'Click'

      These dependencies are all authored by Armin Ronacher, the author of Flask.


    - Flask has no native support for accessing databases, validating web forms, 
        authenticating users, or other high-level tasks.



- Getting Started

    # Install flask in virtual environment
    $ pip install flask

    # Create an empty directory for new application
    $ mkdir flasky
